**AI-Perceivable Distributed Orchestration**

apflow is a distributed task orchestration engine where every capability is AI-perceivable — discoverable, understandable, and invocable by AI agents through the apcore module standard.

## The Tesla Analogy

Think of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD):

```
Tesla = Traditional car systems (brakes, steering, battery management)
        + FSD (the AI brain that perceives and controls everything)

        The braking system doesn't need to be "smart."
        But it must be perceivable and controllable by FSD.

apflow = Traditional orchestration (dependency graphs, priority scheduling,
         distributed coordination)
        + apcore (makes every capability AI-perceivable)

        Task orchestration doesn't need AI.
        But it must be perceivable and invocable by AI agents.
```

**Tesla doesn't build a competitor to FSD — it builds the best car that FSD can control. apflow doesn't build AI agents — it builds the best orchestration engine that AI agents can invoke.**

## What apflow IS and IS NOT

| apflow IS | apflow IS NOT |
|---|---|
| A distributed orchestration engine | An AI agent framework |
| AI-perceivable via apcore | An AI/LLM product |
| Deterministic, reliable task coordination | A competitor to LangGraph/CrewAI |
| The "car systems" that AI agents control | The "FSD brain" itself |

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.11

## Install

```bash
pip install apflow
```

## Quick Start

```python
from apflow import TaskManager, create_session
from apflow.app import create_app

# One line to bootstrap the full stack
app = create_app()

# Start A2A server — AI agents can now discover and invoke orchestration
from apcore_a2a import serve
serve(app.registry, name="apflow")
```

```bash
# Or from the command line
apflow serve              # A2A HTTP server
apflow serve --explorer   # With Explorer UI
apflow mcp                # MCP server (for Claude/Cursor)
apflow info               # Show registered modules
```

## Core Capabilities

### Task Orchestration

Dependency graph execution with priority scheduling, parallel execution, and result aggregation.

```python
tasks = [
    {"id": "fetch", "name": "Fetch Data", "priority": 1},
    {"id": "process", "name": "Process", "parent_id": "fetch", "priority": 2},
    {"id": "notify", "name": "Notify", "parent_id": "process", "priority": 3},
]
tree = await task_creator.create_task_tree_from_array(tasks)
await task_manager.distribute_task_tree(tree)
```

### Durable Execution

Checkpoint/resume, retry with configurable backoff, circuit breaker per executor.

### Cost Governance

Token budget management, model downgrade chains, policy engine (block/downgrade/notify).

### Distributed Coordination

Leader election, task leasing, worker management — scales from single process to multi-node cluster.

### AI-Perceivable (via apcore)

Every orchestration capability is automatically exposed as an apcore Module:
- **MCP** — AI agents (Claude, Cursor) discover and call orchestration tools
- **A2A** — Other services invoke orchestration via HTTP
- **CLI** — Humans operate orchestration from the terminal

## Architecture

```
AI Agents (bring your own — Claude, Gemini, LangGraph, any)
    ↓ invoke via MCP / A2A / CLI
apcore (Module Standard — makes everything AI-perceivable)
    ↓
apflow (This project — deterministic orchestration engine)
  ├─ Task Orchestration (dependency graphs, priority, parallel)
  ├─ Durable Execution (checkpoint, retry, circuit breaker)
  ├─ Cost Governance (budget, policy, downgrade)
  ├─ Distributed Runtime (leader election, leasing)
  └─ Storage (SQLite / PostgreSQL)
```

## Built-in Executors

| Executor | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| RestExecutor | HTTP/REST API calls (example executor) |
| AggregateResultsExecutor | Combine results from dependency tasks |
| ApFlowApiExecutor | Inter-instance orchestration (cluster) |
| SendEmailExecutor | Email notifications |

These are examples and utilities. The real executors are your AI agents, business logic, or any `ExecutableTask` implementation.
